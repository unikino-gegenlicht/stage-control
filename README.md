This repository contains the source code for the stage (remote) control 
software.
It enables us to control the lightning and projector screen via a computer
while allowing remote access to the controls using UDP.
Furthermore, it allows controlling other software running on a PC using DBus or
keyboard shortcuts.
While some applications may receive a direct implementation using one of the
aforementioned control mechanics, other applications may be added using the
configuration files.
